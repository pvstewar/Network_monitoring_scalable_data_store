# Network_monitoring_scalable_data_store


## Creating a Scalable Data Storage System for a large Network Monitoring Application

The purpose of this project was to create starting points for central data storage for a large-scale open-source network monitoring system. Many useful open-source tools are currently available to gather data on a network in a variety of different ways. The main objective here is to examine some of the data available and to explore some of the distributed computing resources available to create a scalable distributed data storage system to gather data from multiple network monitoring endpoints. Three methods were explored, and all are viable but due to various limitations only Pyspark was fully explored. I decided to leave the code for google cloud platform and MongoDB in the notebook as a starting point for potentially exploring those options further at a future time.
